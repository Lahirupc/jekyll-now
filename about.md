I live in Malabe, Sri Lanka. My hobbies were watching movies and playing video games. I'm suprised how things changed over time. Now I'm having less and less time to do those stuff. But I'm finding myself enjoying following MOOCS and reading research papers.

### Education

I was graduated from University of Colombo (Physical Science - IT Major) in 2017. I'm currently a master's student learing things related to AI.

### Research Interest

I'm heavily interested in Computer Vision applications and currently researching on Document Classification.
