title: My first blog post!

Technically this is not my first blog post. This is my second attempt to manage a tech blog, but this time I'm backed by github pages. Hoping to contiunue writing as I'm already motivated.

<!-- The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. -->
